K.; Savini, Tommaso";;;Informing decisions on an extremely data poor species facing imminent extinction;ORYX;;;;;;;;;;;;Some of the species that are believed to have the highest probability of extinction are also amongst the most poorly known, and this makes it extremely difficult to decide how to spend scarce resources. Assessments of conservation status made on the basis of loss or degradation of habitat and lack of records may provide compelling indications of a decline in geographical range and population size, but they do not help identify where conservation action might be best targeted. Methods for assessing the probability of extinction and for modelling species' distributions exist, but their data requirements often exceed the information that is available for some of the most urgent conservation cases. Here we use all available information (localities, expert information, climate and landcover) about a high-priority Vietnamese bird species (Edwards's pheasant Lophura edwardsi) to assess objectively the probability of its persistence, and where surveys or other conservation action should be targeted. It is clear that the species is on the threshold of extinction and there is an urgent need to survey Bach Ma National Park (including the extension) and to consider surveying Ke Go Nature Reserve. This approach has potential to help identify where conservation action should be targeted for other Critically Endangered species for which there is an extreme scarcity of information.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0030-6053;1365-3008;;;;JUL;2019;53;3;;;;;484;490;;10.1017/S0030605317000813;;;;;;;;WOS:000473650400019;;;;;

Perhaps the most useful outputs of a systematic map are an interactive database of studies and their meta-data, along with visualisations of this database. Despite the rapid increase in systematic mapping as an evidence synthesis method, there is currently a lack of Open Source software for producing interactive visualisations of systematic map databases. In April 2018, as attendees at and coordinators of the first ever Evidence Synthesis Hackathon in Stockholm, we decided to address this issue by developing an R-based tool called EviAtlas, an Open Access (i.e. free to use) and Open Source (i.e. software code is freely accessible and reproducible) tool for producing interactive, attractive tables and figures that summarise the evidence base. Here, we present our tool which includes the ability to generate vital visualisations for systematic maps and reviews as follows: a complete data table; a spatially explicit geographical information system (Evidence Atlas); Heat Maps that cross-tabulate two or more variables and display the number of studies belonging to multiple categories; and standard descriptive plots showing the nature of the evidence base, for example the number of studies published per year or number of studies per country.

K.";;;Using the Value of Information to improve conservation decision making;BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS;;;;;;;;;;;;Conservation decisions are challenging, not only because they often involve difficult conflicts among outcomes that people value, but because our understanding of the natural world and our effects on it is fraught with uncertainty. Value of Information (VoI) methods provide an approach for understanding and managing uncertainty from the standpoint of the decision maker. These methods are commonly used in other fields (e.g. economics, public health) and are increasingly used in biodiversity conservation. This decision-analytical approach can identify the best management alternative to select where the effectiveness of interventions is uncertain, and can help to decide when to act and when to delay action until after further research. We review the use of VoI in the environmental domain, reflect on the need for greater uptake of VoI, particularly for strategic conservation planning, and suggest promising areas for new research. We also suggest common reporting standards as a means of increasing the leverage of this powerful tool. The environmental science, ecology and biodiversity categories of the Web of Knowledge were searched using the terms 'Value of Information,' 'Expected Value of Perfect Information,' and the abbreviation 'EVPI.' Google Scholar was searched with the same terms, and additionally the terms decision and biology, biodiversity conservation, fish, or ecology. We identified 1225 papers from these searches. Included studies were limited to those that showed an application of VoI in biodiversity conservation rather than simply describing the method. All examples of use of VOI were summarised regarding the application of VoI, the management objectives, the uncertainties, the models used, how the objectives were measured, and the type of VoI. While the use of VoI appears to be on the increase in biodiversity conservation, the reporting of results is highly variable, which can make it difficult to understand the decision context and which uncertainties were considered. Moreover, it was unclear if, and how, the papers informed management and policy interventions, which is why we suggest a range of reporting standards that would aid the use of VoI. The use of VoI in conservation settings is at an early stage. There are opportunities for broader applications, not only for species-focussed management problems, but also for setting local or global research priorities for biodiversity conservation, making funding decisions, or designing or improving protected area networks and management. The long-term benefits of applying VoI methods to biodiversity conservation include a more structured and decision-focused allocation of resources to research.;;;;"; Grainger, Matthew/K-6539-2019";"Mengersen, Kerrie/0000-0001-8625-9168; Grainger, Matthew/0000-0001-8426-6495; Bolam, Friederike/0000-0002-2021-0828";;;;;;;;;;;;1464-7931;1469-185X;;;;APR;2019;94;2;;;;;629;647;;10.1111/brv.12471;;;;;;;;WOS:000461070800015;30280477;;;;

For some species, a detailed understanding of microhabitat selection is critical for this, especially in the breeding season. Methods: To understand the factors that explain how specific habitats are used by the Grey Peacock-pheasant (Polyplectron bicalcaratum) in the breeding season, we used camera trapping and microhabitat sampling to assess the microhabitat selection of males. We also looked at their interaction with predators in an area of 1200 m x 1200 m at the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand, between January and May 2013. Results: We show that display scrapes are situated on flatter open areas with small saplings and some vines, typified by low horizontal understory density. We hypothesise that this allows a trade-off between courtship display and the avoidance of predators. Our study showed that the position of Grey Peacock-pheasant display scrapes regularly overlapped with predators within the same microhabitat. We hypothesise that the species' behavioural responses to temporal variation in predation risk allows them to avoid most predators. Conclusions: Particular microhabitats are required for Grey Peacock-pheasant display. They avoid predators at these places by being active when predators are not.;;;;Grainger, Matthew/K-6539-2019;Grainger, Matthew/0000-0001-8426-6495;;;;;;;;;;;;2053-7166;;;;;MAY 21;2018;9;;;;;;;;17;10.1186/s40657-018-0107-8;;;;;;;;WOS:000433253900001;;;;;

K.; Savini, Tommaso";;;Conservation status of Phasianidae in Southeast Asia;BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION;;;;;;;;;;;;Local and regional extirpations of individual species, typically high profile cases, are now well documented, leading to calls for urgent action for particular species in specific locations. There is a need to broaden our assessments of extinction to identify landscapes that contain high proportions of threatened species and therefore, how more holistic species conservation responses might be developed. The conservation status of species is especially concerning in Southeast Asia and within the region, the avian family Phasianidae affords the opportunity to develop an approach for examining species richness and extinction probability for an entire family at landscape scale. There are 42 pheasant, partridge and quail species in the region and 77% of Southeast Asia encompasses the geographic range of at least five species. Due to high levels of uncertainty about how species respond to anthropogenic threats, we created an expert elicited Bayesian Belief Network to explore survival prospects using publically available data on IUCN extinction probability categories, proxies of threat (effects of hunting, forest loss and protected area effectiveness) and species geographic ranges to assess where the overall risk to survival was highest. Western Myanmar, Central Indoburma (Thailand/Myanmar), the Annamite mountains and Central Vietnam lowlands, Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo are priorities for avoiding large numbers of extinctions of phasianids. This assessment will be strengthened by more detailed data on intensity of hunting pressure across the region, and variation in species' tolerance to human disturbance. Strategically, therefore, conservation and research should be targeted towards these landscapes.;;;;Grainger, Matthew/K-6539-2019;Grainger, Matthew/0000-0001-8426-6495;;;;;;;;;;;;0006-3207;1873-2917;;;;APR;2018;220;;;;;;60;66;;10.1016/j.biocon.2018.02.005;;;;;;;;WOS:000429765000007;;;;;

Most studies on consumers' food waste use models that identify covariates as significant when in fact they may not be, particularly where these models use many variables. Here, using EU-level Eurobarometer data from 2013, we use alternative analytical methods that avoid these problems (Bayesian Networks) to identify the impact of household characteristics and other variables on self-assessed food waste. Our analysis confirmed that the country, the age of the respondent, the status (student/non-student), and a belief that the family wastes too much are related to the level of self-assessed food waste. But we found no evidence that waste behaviours differ between people living in urban and rural areas, and little support of a difference between genders. Households from lower-income EU countries (e.g. Portugal, Greece, Bulgaria, Cyprus and Latvia), as well as students and young adults tend to report higher levels of food waste. Hence, the adoption of an EU strategy based on the concept of subsidiarity, and of country-level policy measures targeting different age groups is suggested. Furthermore, our analysis shows that policy makers need to be wary of relying on analysis based on large datasets that do not control for false-positives, particularly when sample sizes are small.;;;;"Righi, Simone/B-3388-2013; Grainger, Matthew/K-6539-2019";"Righi, Simone/0000-0001-9821-8451; Grainger, Matthew/0000-0001-8426-6495; Piras, Simone/0000-0003-0334-6800";;;;;;;;;;;;2211-9124;;;;;MAR;2018;16;;;;;;1;8;;10.1016/j.gfs.2017.12.005;;;;;;;;WOS:000427995500001;;;;;

C.; Fitzsimmons, Clare";;;Socio-economic, technological and environmental drivers of spatio-temporal changes in fishing pressure;MARINE POLICY;;;;;;;;;;;;As part of an ecosystem based approach to fisheries management (EBFM), the heterogeneity of biological communities, key ecological processes and human uses must be understood. Although fishing effort distribution and marine habitat distribution and use are increasingly well understood, little research has quantified spatio-temporal changes in fishing effort or investigated drivers of these changes. Here, a holistic approach was taken to investigate socio-economic, environmental and technological drivers of change in fishing effort distribution of the Northumberland pot-fishery (2004-2014) using Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) analyses. BBNs were populated using large-scale high resolution spatial and temporal fisheries monitoring data, quantitative and qualitative interviews with fishers and expert opinion. Increases in fishing effort over time were explained by a combination of changes in fleet composition and fishers' behaviour. Increasing vessel and engine sizes, combined with an increased uptake of improved fishing technology have resulted in a greater ability for vessels to fish a greater number of pots. This increase in vessel and fishing capability has resulted in fishers' increased ability to fish in harsher weather conditions, as well as target specific areas or habitats quickly and opportunistically. Non technological factors, such as declines in stocks of finfish and nephrops and the increasing operational costs of participating in these fisheries may have resulted in fishers solely fishing in the less regulated pot-fishery, targeting high value European lobster on a full-time basis. Increasing costs of pot-fishing in Northumberland coupled with stagnating crab and lobster landings prices may have resulted in increased fishing effort to maintain profitability.;;;;Grainger, Matthew/K-6539-2019;"Grainger, Matthew/0000-0001-8426-6495; Stephenson, Fabrice/0000-0002-9500-5204";;;;;;;;;;;;0308-597X;1872-9460;;;;FEB;2018;88;;;;;;189;203;;10.1016/j.marpol.2017.11.029;;;;;;;;WOS:000424961300023;;;;;

Therefore, food waste reduction requires an understanding of the socioeconomic (contextual and behavioural) factors that lead to its generation within the household. Addressing such a complex subject calls for sound methodological approaches that until now have been conditioned by the large number of factors involved in waste generation, by the lack of a recognised definition, and by limited available data. This work contributes to food waste generation literature by using one of the largest available datasets that includes data on the objective amount of avoidable household food waste, along with information on a series of socio-economic factors. In order to address one aspect of the complexity of the problem, machine learning algorithms (random forests and boruta) for variable selection integrated with linear modelling, model selection and averaging are implemented. Model selection addresses model structural uncertainty, which is not routinely considered in assessments of food waste in literature. The main drivers of food waste in the home selected in the most parsimonious models include household size, the presence of fussy eaters, employment status, home ownership status, and the local authority. Results, regardless of which variable set the models are run on, point toward large households as being a key target element for food waste reduction interventions.;;;;"Grainger, Matthew/K-6539-2019; Righi, Simone/B-3388-2013";"Grainger, Matthew/0000-0001-8426-6495; Righi, Simone/0000-0001-9821-8451; Piras, Simone/0000-0003-0334-6800";;;;;;;;;;;;1932-6203;;;;;feb.01;2018;13;2;;;;;;;e0192075;10.1371/journal.pone.0192075;;;;;;;;WOS:000423793400062;29389949;;;;

Many bird species in Asia inhabit areas that are challenging to survey; we consider the basis of some of the more widely used methods in order to assess which are likely to be useful for providing data on populations. We review four methods: 1) spot napping; 2) triangulation; 3) distance sampling (using line transects and point counts); and 4) camera trap sampling. Four aspects were assessed: What has it been used,for? What are the method's assumptions? What field protocol is, required? What analytical methods should be used? Spot mappin6 and triangulation are bOth based on the ability to detect individuals of the target species in the field, but lack a statistical basis for converting this into a meaningful estimate about the population surveyed. Distance sampling is, in contrast, based on sampling theory and meeting some of the assumptions for detecting individuals in the field can be difficult. Nonetheless, it is increasingly widely used and considered reliable for making estimates about bird populations. Finally, camera trapping is a useful method for rare and cryptic species and the analytical techniques that cover the wide range of contexts in which it may be used are being developed.";;;;Grainger, Matthew/K-6539-2019;Grainger, Matthew/0000-0001-8426-6495;;;;;;;;;;;;0950-1746;;;;;;2016;;32;;;;;5;13;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000404813600002;;;;;

Here we estimate the density of the threatened grey peacock-pheasant (Polyplectron bicalcaratum) in the pristine sub-montane evergreen forest of Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, Western Thailand, where poaching is low. In our density assessments, we compared four commonly used survey methods: (a) triangulation using fixed listening posts; distance sampling using both (b) line transects and (c) point transects; and (d) camera trapping using the single season Royle-Nichols heterogeneity model, to assess which one is the most appropriate for population estimation in such a loud-calling terrestrial bird species. Species density was estimated between 14.69 and 22.97 birds km(-2) depending on the method used. The use of auditory records to compensate for low visual detection of this cryptic species might explain the higher estimates when compared with those reported for other populations. When comparing different methods point transects and triangulation provided similar density estimates, with point transects appearing to be the most effective method due to their precision and the clear analysis protocol, while density estimates provided by triangulation depend on species specific knowledge, thereby hampering translation of detections into a population estimate. Line transects appeared to overestimate density and presented logistic difficulties in these mountainous locations, although its suitability for the survey of larger areas might render it appropriate in flat terrains.

When these trees die, they create large canopy gaps. If this promotes the persistence of pioneer species to the detriment of other forest species, then the end goal of a restored coastal dune forest may be unobtainable. We wished to ascertain whether tree species composition and richness differed significantly between canopy gaps and intact canopy, and across a gradient of gap sizes. In three known-age regenerating coastal dune forest sites, we measured 146 gaps, the species responsible for gap creation, the species most likely to reach the canopy and the composition of adults, seedlings and saplings. We paired each gap with an adjacent plot of the same area that was entirely under intact canopy and sampled in the same way. Most species (15 of 23) had higher abundance in canopy gaps. The probability of self-replacement was low for A. karroo even in the largest gaps. Despite this predominance of shade-intolerant species, regenerating dune forest appears to be in the first phase of succession with forest pioneers' replacing the dominant canopy species. The nature of these species should lead to successful regeneration of dune forest.;;;;Grainger, Matthew/K-6539-2019;Grainger, Matthew/0000-0001-8426-6495;;;;;;;;;;;;0141-6707;;;;;MAR;2013;51;1;;;;;11;20;;10.1111/j.1365-2028.2012.01348.x;;;;;;;;WOS:000314658200002;;;;;

Comments on Ntshotsho et al. (2010);RESTORATION ECOLOGY;;;;;;;;;;;;In their article Assessing the evidence base for restoration in South Africa, Ntshotsho et al. attempt to determine whether restoration in South Africa is evidence based by reporting on 10 projects' baseline data collection, goal setting, and monitoring. However, their contribution suffers from two major constraints. First, they confuse assessing the evidence base with assessing whether restoration is evidence based. Truly, assessing the evidence base would entail a systematic review of the quantity and quality of information available as well as the conclusions supported, perhaps in a meta-analytical framework. Determining if restoration is evidence based would require a survey of project managers to evaluate if they take decisions based on scientific information. Second, Ntshotsho et al. do not clearly distinguish successfully achieving restoration project goals from successfully restoring ecosystems. They largely focus on projects' socioeconomic goals without emphasizing that these goals are, by definition, secondary to ecological goals in determining restoration success. Thus, Ntshotsho et al. provide neither a sound assessment of the evidence base for restoration nor whether restoration is evidence based. To evaluate and encourage evidence-based restoration in South Africa, we recommend a simple assessment of the basis on which restoration managers make decisions, identification of factors precluding evidence-based decision-making, and development of platforms to evaluate the data collected in restoration programs to generate an evidence base from which to make defendable decisions.;;;;"Grainger, Matthew/K-6539-2019; Trimble, Morgan/B-1161-2010";"Grainger, Matthew/0000-0001-8426-6495; Trimble, Morgan/0000-0002-9914-0788";;;;;;;;;;;;1061-2971;;;;;JAN;2012;20;1;;;;;7;9;;10.1111/j.1526-100X.2011.00817.x;;;;;;;;WOS:000298845500002;;;;;
